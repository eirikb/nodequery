                <h2>Is this a real FAQ or just some king of monolog?</h2>
                <p>It's a real FAQ!</p>
                <h2>What is the point doing templating this way?</h2>
                <p>It's a new and revolutionary way of templating!<br>
                   This is how people are used to look at their markup, they add styling and scripting from the outside.<br>
                   So why not do the dynamic serverside scripting the same way?</p>
               <h2>Seriously though, do you think it is usable</h2>
               <p>Nah, I just want the internet creds</p>
               <h2>This has never been done before?</h2>
               <p>Not that I have seen, but I'm failry sure it has been done, but maybe not with jQuery on node.js :)</p>
