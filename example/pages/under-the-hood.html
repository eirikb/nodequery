                    So (almost) all creds have to go to the <a href="https://github.com/tmpvar">author</a> of that library!</p>
                <p>I'm basically just using their library in a slightly different way.<br>
                    They much intended it to do scraping of other web pages, but I use it to scrape and edit my own .html-files and display them accordingly.</p>
