                <p>This library is 97% <a href="https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom">jsdom</a>.<br>
                    So (almost) all creds have to go to the <a href="https://github.com/tmpvar">author</a> of that library!</p>
                <p>I'm basically just using their library in a slightly different way.<br>
                    They much intended it to do scraping of other web pages, but I use it to scrape and edit my own .html-files and display them accordingly.</p>
                <h2>Perfrmance</h2>
                <p>Performance of this framework? Blazing fast! At least in theory.<br>
                    It will store a finished built DOM for each page in memory, as well as the dynamic function.
                    So all the server has to do is to clone the DOM and throw the function at it, and everything is already in memory!<br>
                    The rest is up to the function, as db calls, external API calls and heavy calcuation can make it slowish.<p>
                <p>That said, the framework does not currently store the built DOM in memory, only the markup, because of troubleness.</p>
